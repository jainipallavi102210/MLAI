## Overview

This Jupyter notebook project focuses on analyzing and understanding the Access to Special Healthcare Services Among Children dataset from the years 2016 to 2021.

## Contents

### Data Exploration and Cleaning

* Examined features for missing values and data types.
* Cleaned and preprocessed the dataset for analysis.

### Descriptive Analysis

* Calculated and visualized the percentage of affected children, % of boys, % of girls, and other relevant statistics based on the dataset.
  
### Time Series Analysis

* Analyzed the dataset over the years to understand trends.
* Computed the total number of children, affected children, and the percentage of affected children for each year.
* Utilized ARIMA and other forecasting models to predict future values for 2021 and 2022.

### Results and Visualizations

* Presented key findings using visualizations such as bar plots, pie charts, and line graphs.
* Provided insights into the distribution of CSHCN types, complexity levels, and access to healthcare services.

## Files Included

1. Notebook - [capstone_multipleyears.ipynb](capstone_multipleyears.ipynb): Jupyter notebooks for data analysis and visualization.:
 * The main Jupyter notebook containing the entire analysis, code, and visualizations.
2. Data - `data/data_consolidated.csv`:
 * The dataset used for analysis.

## Dependencies
